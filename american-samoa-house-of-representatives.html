            The American Samoa House of Representatives is the lower house of the American Samoa Fono. The House consists of 21 members serving two-year terms, with 20 popularly elected representatives, and one delegate from Swains Island elected in a public meeting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>American Samoa became a United States territory in 1900 and was initially administered by the Navy. From 1905, annual meetings were held with delegates sent from the local communities, as an advisory council to the naval governor.<br/><br/>In 1948, a bicameral legislature was established, still in advisory capacity. The lower house, named the House of Representatives, was composed of 54 members: 52 (one from each village) were elected in open meetings according to Samoan custom, and two were elected by secret ballot by residents not living under the matai system. The first session of the legislature was called to order by Attorney General John D. Maroney at 9:30 am on 26 October 1948, and high orator Mariota Tiumalu Tuiasosopo was unanimously elected as the Speaker of the House of Representatives.<br/><br/>The legislature was reformed in 1952, after administration of American Samoa had been transferred to the Department of the Interior. The number of representatives was reduced to 18, all elected by secret ballot: five from each of the three districts of American Samoa (Western, Eastern and Manu‘a), one from Swains Island, and two elected by residents not living under the matai system.<br/><br/>In 1960, the first constitution of American Samoa was adopted.
