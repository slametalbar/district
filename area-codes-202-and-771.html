            Area codes 202 and 771 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Washington, D.C.<br/><br/>Area code 202 was one of the original North American area codes established in October 1947 by the American Telephone and Telegraph  Company (AT&amp;T). After the State of New Jersey with area code 201, the District of Columbia was the second numbering plan area (NPA). Area code 771 was added to the numbering plan area in April 2021 in creation of an overlay complex to mitigate impending telephone number shortages.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Since the creation of the first nationwide telephone numbering plan in 1947, most of the inner ring of the Washington metropolitan area has been a single local calling area, the Washington Metropolitan Exchange Area (WMEA). This is despite the fact that the WMEA was split between three numbering plan areas (NPAs): the District's 202, 301 in southern Maryland, and 703 in Northern Virginia. From the 1950s to 1990, it was possible to complete local calls in the WMEA with only seven digits. The entire WMEA was reachable via long-distance services by dialing area code 202, for which purpose AT&amp;T Long Lines had established cross-referenced operator routing codes for all affected central offices. This scheme was implemented via a system of central office code protection, in which central offices in the three numbering plan areas could not duplicate any central office prefixes for any of the three area codes in the WMEA. For example, if the 202-574 exchange was in use in the District, the corresponding 703-574 or 301-574 exchange could only be assigned a safe distance from the metropolitan area, such as southwestern Virginia or the Eastern Shore of Maryland.<br/><br/>By spring 1990, C&amp;P Telephone (later part of Bell Atlantic and now Verizon), the Regional Bell Operating Company for the District, advised the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) that the last interchangeable central office code in the area would be assigned in the second half of the year. The only remaining prefixes could not be assigned without eliminating seven-digit dialing in the region, leading C&amp;P to terminate the central office code protection arrangement to make additional prefixes available for use.
