            Linkou District (Chinese: 林口區; pinyin: Línkǒu Qū; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Nâ-kháu khu) is a district in the northwestern part of New Taipei City in northern Taiwan. The name "Linkou" translates to "forest mouth"; in fact, for much of its history, Linkou remained a relatively rural and undeveloped district. This has recently begun to change: Since the latter half of the 2010s, Linkou has been undergoing a period of rapid population growth and land development relative to other nearby districts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>As of February 2023, Linkou District had a population of 128,929, an increase of over 41% compared to the population in 2011 – giving it one of the fastest population growth rates in New Taipei City. Linkou has a land area of 54.15 km2, including many forested areas and canyons.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Administrative divisions ==<br/><br/>The district administers 17 urban villages (all seventeen of which were rural villages (村) before changes made on 25 December 2010):<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Linkou New Town ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Since 1968, the government has planned to establish a new town in Linkou to relieve the overcrowded Taipei City. In 1975, it was released and implemented with the Linkou Interchange of National Freeway 1 as the center, including the planning of both industrial and residential areas. To the north of Linkou Interchange is Linkou District, New Taipei City, and to the south is Guishan District, Taoyuan City. The new town spans the two cities but was still named Linkou. However, some facilities and businesses in the planned new town that use "Linkou" in their name, such as Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Fullon Hotel Linkou, are actually located in Guishan District rather than Linkou District.
