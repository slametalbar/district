            The flags of the U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) exhibit a variety of regional influences and local histories, as well as different styles and design principles. Modern U.S. state flags date from the turn of the 20th century, when states considered distinctive symbols for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Most U.S. state flags were designed and adopted between 1893 and World War I.<br/><br/>The most recently adopted state flag is that of Minnesota, adopted on May 11, 2024, while the most recently adopted territorial flag is that of the Northern Mariana Islands, adopted on July 1, 1985. The flag of the District of Columbia was adopted in 1938. Recent legislations in Massachusetts (2021) and Illinois (2024) have started the process of redesigning their state flag. Michigan also has plans to redesign their flag in the future, but this has not been confirmed. Maine had put a flag redesign on the ballot in November 2024, but the redesign had failed the vote.<br/><br/>Despite a variety of designs, the majority of the states' flags share the same design pattern consisting of the state seal superimposed on a monochrome <br/><br/>background, commonly a shade of blue, which remains a source of criticism from vexillologists. According to a 2001 survey by the North American Vexillological Association, New Mexico has the best-designed flag of any U.S. state, U.S. territory, or Canadian province, while Georgia's state flag was rated the worst (the latter of which has been changed since the survey was conducted).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Current state flags ==<br/><br/>Listed alphabetically with their respective date of adoption.
