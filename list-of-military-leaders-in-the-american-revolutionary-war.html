            Several military leaders played a role in the American Revolutionary War. This is a compilation of some of the most important leaders among the many participants in the war. Militia: a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency or a body of citizens organized for military service. In order to be listed here an individual must satisfy one of the following criteria:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Was a nation's top civilian responsible for directing military affairs<br/><br/>Held a commission of at least brigadier general or rear admiral in an organized military during the conflict<br/><br/>Was the highest-ranking member of a given nation's force that participated in the conflict (if that rank was not at least major general)<br/><br/>Was the highest-ranking member of a given state/colonial militia<br/><br/>Was a provincial or territorial governor who is documented to have directed a military action<br/><br/>Was a Native American tribal leader who had a documented leadership position in military action<br/><br/>Some individuals held concurrent positions in more than one organization, and a number of Continental Army generals also held high-ranking positions in their state militia organizations<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== United States ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the war began, because the American colonists feared a very strong armed force (also known as a "standing army"), each colony had traditionally provided its own defense through the use of local militia. Each of which had their own command hierarchy. Some states, most notably Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, also had their own navies.<br/><br/>Seeking to coordinate military efforts, the Continental Congress established (on paper) a regular army—the Continental Army—in June 1775, and appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington reluctantly augmented the regular troops with militia throughout the war.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== General and Commander-in-chief ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Continental Army ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Major generals ====<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Brigadier generals ====<br/><br/>John Armstrong Sr.<br/><br/>George Clinton<br/><br/>Elias Dayton<br/><br/>Joseph Frye<br/><br/>Christopher Gadsden<br/><br/>John Glover<br/><br/>Mordecai Gist<br/><br/>John Greaton.
