            Foggy Bottom is a neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States, located in the city's northwest quadrant. It stretches west of the White House towards the Potomac River, north of the National Mall, east of Georgetown, south of the West End neighborhood and west of Downtown D.C.  <br/><br/>The neighborhood is best known for hosting the headquarters of the U.S. Department of State, for which the name "Foggy Bottom" is commonly used as a metonym. It is also home to federal agencies and international institutions, including the Federal Reserve, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund; the core of the neighborhood is occupied by George Washington University.   <br/><br/>Within greater Foggy Bottom, there is a four block Historic District with modest row houses and alleys dating from as early as the 1870s and which housed working class Irish, German and African Americans during the historic period of 1860-1915. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Foggy Bottom area was the site of one of the earliest European settlements in what is now Washington, D.C., when German settler Jacob Funk (or Funck) subdivided 130 acres (0.53 km2) near the meeting place of the Potomac River and Rock Creek in 1763. The settlement officially was named Hamburgh, but colloquially was called Funkstown. In 1765, German settlers established the town of Hamburg on what would become the area between 24th and 18th NW Street. There are reportedly two more founders: Robert Peter and James Linigan. The three had control of the land until 1791 when the territories were given to the city of Washington and the United States government. In the town of Hamburg, a German community was founded by many German immigrants.
