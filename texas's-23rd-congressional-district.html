            Texas's 2nd congressional district of the United States House of Representatives is in the southeastern portion of the state of Texas. It encompasses parts of northern and eastern Harris County and southern Montgomery County, Texas.<br/><br/>From 2002 to 2012, it stretched from Houston's northern suburbs through eastern Harris County, and across Southeast Texas to the Louisiana border. As of the 2000 census, the 2nd district represented 651,619 people.  The district's configuration dates from the 2003 Texas redistricting, when most of the old 9th district was split among three neighboring districts. The four-term Democratic incumbent in the 9th district, Nick Lampson, was unseated by Republican Ted Poe, a longtime felony-court judge in Harris County. In November 2017, Poe announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term, and did not seek re-election in 2018. Dan Crenshaw was elected on November 6, 2018 and is currently serving as congressman.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 2012 redistricting ==<br/><br/>The 2012 redistricting process radically changed the district. Beaumont, which had been part of the 2nd and its predecessors for over a century, was removed along with all of Jefferson County.
