            An Indian massacre is any incident in which a significant number of indigenous peoples of the Americas, as a group, killed or were killed  outside the confines of mutual combat in war.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>"Indian massacre" is a phrase whose use and definition has evolved and expanded over time.  European colonists initially used the phrase to describe attacks by indigenous Americans which resulted in mass colonial casualties.  While similar attacks by colonists on Indian villages were called "raids" or "battles", successful Indian attacks on white settlements or military posts were routinely termed "massacres".  Knowing very little about the native inhabitants of the American frontier, the colonists were deeply fearful, and often, European Americans who had rarely – or never – seen a Native American read Indian atrocity stories in popular literature and newspapers. Emphasis was placed on the depredations of "murderous savages" in their information about Indians, and as the migrants headed further west, they frequently feared the Indians they would encounter.<br/><br/>The phrase eventually became commonly used to also describe mass killings of American Indians.  Killings described as "massacres" often had an element of indiscriminate targeting, barbarism, or genocidal intent.<br/><br/>According to historian Jeffrey Ostler, "Any discussion of genocide must, of course, eventually consider the so-called Indian Wars, the term commonly used for U.S. Army campaigns to subjugate Indian nations of the American West beginning in the 1860s. In an older historiography, key events in this history were narrated as battles.
