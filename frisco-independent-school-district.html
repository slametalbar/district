            Frisco Independent School District is a public school district based in Frisco, Texas, United States. The district covers portions of Denton and Collin counties, including portions of the cities of Frisco, Little Elm, Plano, and McKinney as well as unincorporated land.<br/><br/>The district was originally formed in 1876 and was known as the Farmers School District. Small schoolhouses served the rural population at that time. The community of Frisco began to emerge in 1902 and the school district was renamed.<br/><br/>The district is one of the largest in Texas and the nation. In 1995, Frisco ISD had four schools. Since then, the district has added 71 new schools, opening two to six campuses annually. No public school district in the country grew faster from 1990–91 to 2010–11, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.<br/><br/>In 2022, the school district was one of the best in the state, receiving the highest Texas Accountability rating of "A".
