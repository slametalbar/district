            The District of Columbia is a federal district with an ethnically diverse population. On July 2024, the District had a population of 702,250 people, with a resident density of 11,515 people per square mile.<br/><br/>The District of Columbia had relatively few residents until the Civil War. The presence of the U.S. federal government in Washington has been instrumental in the city's later growth and development. Its role as the capital leads people to forget that approximately one-third of the District of Columbia's population was born in the city.<br/><br/>In 2011, the District of Columbia's Black population slipped below 50 percent for the first time in over 50 years. The District was a majority-Black district from the late 1950s through 2011. The District of Columbia has had a significant African-American population since the District's creation; several neighborhoods are noted for their contributions to Black history and culture. Like numerous other border and northern cities in the first half of the 20th century, the District of Columbia received many black migrants from the South in the Great Migration. African Americans moved north for better education and job opportunities, as well as to escape legal segregation and lynchings.
