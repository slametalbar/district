            The Arts District is a performing and visual arts district in downtown Dallas, Texas.<br/><br/>The district is 118 acres (0.47 km2) large and is home to some of Dallas’ most significant cultural landmarks including facilities for visual, performing, and developing arts. It is located south of State Thomas; southeast of Uptown; north of the City Center District; west of Bryan Place; and east of the West End Historic District. It is bounded by St. Paul Street, Ross Avenue, Spur 366 (Woodall Rodgers Freeway), and the US 75/I-45 (unsigned I-345) elevated freeway (Central Expressway). (Previously the district extended east only to Routh Street, but a 9 March 2005 Dallas City Council approval extended it east to I-345.) The Arts District is a member of the Global Cultural Districts Network. In 2025, USA Today named the Dallas Arts District as the best art district in America for a creative escape for the second consecutive year.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Arts District venues ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Arts District is home to 18 facilities and organizations including The Annette Strauss Square, the Arts District Mansion/Dallas Bar Association, Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Dallas Black Dance Theatre, Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Dallas Theater Center, Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, Nasher Sculpture Center, St. Paul United Methodist Church, Fellowship Church, First United Methodist Church, Margot &amp; Bill Winspear Opera House, Dee and Charles Wyly Theater, Moody Performance Hall, the Green Family Art Foundation, and the Crow Museum of Asian Art, housed in a portion of the Trammell Crow Center.<br/><br/>In addition, multiple other organizations perform in the District consistently throughout the year.
