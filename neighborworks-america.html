            The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, doing business as NeighborWorks America, is a congressionally chartered nonprofit organization that supports community development in the United States and Puerto Rico. The organization provides grants and technical assistance to more than 240 community development organizations. Neighbor Works America provides training for housing and community development professionals through its national training institutes. Since 2007, Neighbor Works America has administered the congressionally created National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program.<br/><br/>The Neighbor Works network comprises more than 240 community development organizations working in urban, suburban, and rural communities across the country.<br/><br/>The Neighborhood Reinvestment Board of Directors consists of the Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, a member of the Chief Counsel Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Vice Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and a member of the Board of the National Credit Union Administration.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The early origins of the nonprofit NeighborWorks America are traced to 1968, when Dorothy Mae Richardson, a Central North Side resident of Pittsburgh, started a campaign for better housing in her neighborhood. Dorothy Mae Richardson worked with city bankers and government officials to convince 16 financial institutions to give out conventional loans in the community. Her legacy was an organization named the Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) of Pittsburgh. Eventually, Neighborhood Housing Services of Pittsburgh became the national model for community-based housing initiatives throughout the country.
