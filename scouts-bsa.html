            Scouts BSA (known as Boy Scouts until 2019) is the flagship program and membership level of Scouting America for coeducational children and teenagers between the ages of typically 11 and 17. It provides youth training in character, citizenship, personal fitness, and leadership, and aims to develop the skills necessary to become successful adults.<br/><br/>To foster these skills, Scouting utilizes eight methods of Scouting to guide their educational programing: scouting ideals (as exemplified by the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Scout Motto, and the Scout Slogan), the patrol method of working in small groups, participation in outdoor programs, advancement and recognition for achievements, adult leaders, personal growth, leadership development, and the uniform.<br/><br/>The participants, also known as Scouts, are organized into small groups called Scout troops, which are led by youth leaders given the title of senior patrol leaders (SPLs), as well as adult leaders, called Scouters. In February 2019, the program began admitting girls as well as boys, and the name of the program was changed from "Boy Scouts" to "Scouts BSA".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Aims and Methods ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Scouts BSA is focused on developing four skills: Character, Citizenship, Personal Fitness, and Leadership. These qualities are promoted through the eight methods of Scouting: scouting ideals (as exemplified by the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Scout Motto, and the Scout Slogan); the patrol method;  advancement;  adult association; participation in outdoor programs; personal growth; leadership development, and the uniform.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Program and activities ==<br/><br/>Troop programs and activities are determined by the senior patrol leader and a council of adults under the oversight of the Scoutmaster. Troops generally hold meetings weekly, although they can be irregular during the summer. Troop meeting activities can include training in Scout skills to planning camping trips or playing games.
