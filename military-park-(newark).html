            Military Park is a 6-acre (24,000 m2) city park in Downtown Newark in Newark, New Jersey. Along with Lincoln Park and Washington Park, it makes up the three downtown parks in Newark that were laid out in the colonial era. It is a nearly triangular park located between Park Place, Rector Street and Broad Street.<br/><br/>The New Jersey Historical Society, Military Park Building,  the New Jersey Performing Arts Center,  the Robert Treat Center and the newly built One Theatre Square and 50 Rector St buildings are located across Park Place from the park. A $3.25 million renovation led by Dan Biederman was announced in February 2012. The reconstruction was expected to be completed in late  2013, but due to harsh weather was postponed until spring 2014. A casual restaurant, Burg, does business in the park. The park reopened in June 2014.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The park was originally laid out by Robert Treat at the founding of Newark as a training ground for soldiers. It saw periodic military use throughout its history; it served as a training ground during the French and Indian War,  a campground for the American army in the American Revolution and the War of 1812.
