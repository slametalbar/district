            Cub Scouts is a Scouting America program available to coeducational children from kindergarten through fifth grade (or 5 to 10 years of age) and their families. Its membership is the largest of the five main Scouting America divisions (Cub Scouting, Scouts BSA, Venturing, Exploring and Sea Scouting). Cub Scouts is part of the worldwide Scouting movement and aims to promote character development, citizenship training, personal fitness, and leadership. Cub Scouts are organized into local packs where they complete requirements to advance in rank as well as engage in pack events such as the Pinewood Derby.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>As early as 1911, Ernest Thompson Seton had developed a prototype program he named Cub Scouts of America that was never implemented. James E. West felt that having BSA divisions for younger boys (those under 12; the "younger boy problem") would draw away boys from the core program, which was Scout troops focused on the 12- to 17-year-old age group; thus he opposed such a program for some time. In spite of this, unofficial programs for younger boys started around this time, under names such as Junior Troops or Cadet Corps. The BSA obtained the rights to Lord Baden-Powell's The Wolf Cub's Handbook in 1916 and used it in unofficial Wolf Cub programs starting in 1918. This led to an issue with Daniel Carter Beard who felt that the use of the British book was nearly disloyal to the United States of America. West encouraged the formation of the Boy Rangers of America, a separate organization for boys eight through twelve based on an American Indian theme.
