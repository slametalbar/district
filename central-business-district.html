            A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business center of a city. It contains commercial space and offices, and in larger cities will often be described as a financial district. Geographically, it often coincides with the "city centre" or "downtown". However, these concepts are not necessarily synonymous: many cities have a central business district located away from its traditional city center, and there may be multiple CBDs within a single urban area. The CBD will often be highly accessible and have a large variety and concentration of specialised goods and services compared to other parts of the city. Midtown Manhattan is the world's largest central business district. In the City of London, the largest concentration of economic output in the world is held there, with many headquarters of major financial and law firms being based in the City.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Chicago, the Chicago Loop is the second-largest central business district in the United States. It is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown.<br/><br/>Mexico City also has its own historic city center, the colonial era "Centro Histórico", along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century Paseo de la Reforma in Polanco, and the new Santa Fe, respectively.
