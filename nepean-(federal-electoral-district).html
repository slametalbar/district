            Nepean is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 1997, and was reinstated during the 2012 electoral redistribution.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The original riding was created in 1987 from parts of the Nepean—Carleton riding. It consisted of the City of Nepean. The electoral district was abolished in 1996 when it was redistributed between the Nepean—Carleton (54%) and the Ottawa West—Nepean (46%) ridings. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2012 Federal Redistribution ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The riding was then reinstated in 2012 by Elections Canada, taking effect upon the dropping of the writs for the 2015 federal election, scheduled for 19 October 2015. All of the current riding comes from parts of the former riding of Nepean—Carleton.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2022 Federal Redistribution ===<br/><br/>The 2022 Federal Redistribution resulted in a largely rural area (south of Bells Corners, west of the 416 and south of Barnsdale Road) being reallocated to the riding of Carleton. The urban parts of Bells Corners, west of the 416 and north of Hunt Club Road, have been shifted to the new Kanata riding.<br/><br/>In a simplification of boundaries, the riding also picked up a portion of the Ottawa West—Nepean riding on its north side. The railway line is now the boundary between the two ridings, whereas previously it formed only the western part of the boundary, with Merivale Road and West Hunt Club forming the eastern boundary.
