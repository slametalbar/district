            Colorado's 5th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Colorado. The district lies in the center of the state and comprises Colorado Springs and its suburbs including Cimarron Hills and Fort Carson.<br/><br/>The district is currently represented by Republican Jeff Crank. Historically one of the most Republican districts in Colorado, redistricting and growing Democratic strength in Colorado Springs and suburbs such as Cimarron Hills, Fountain, and Security-Widefield have shifted the district strongly to the left. However it is still a slight Republican-leaning district with a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of R+5.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Characteristics ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Politics ===<br/><br/>The Republican Party has held control of the seat since the district's creation. Colorado Springs, the main population center within the district, is home to many conservative Christian organizations. Among these groups are Focus on the Family, its founder Dr. James Dobson (who is considered by some to be the most influential evangelical leader in the country), New Life Church, Compassion International, HCJB, and many others. There is some Democratic strength in this district in urban Colorado Springs and some of its suburbs near Pikes Peak, but it is no match for the overwhelming Republican tilt of the district; however, unlike the nearby 4th that is trending more Republican by the year, the 5th is becoming slightly less Republican due to demographic changes.
