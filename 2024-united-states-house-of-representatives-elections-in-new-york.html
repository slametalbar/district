            The 2024 United States House of Representatives elections in New York were held on November 5, 2024, to elect the 26 U.S. representatives from the State of New York, one from each of the state's 26 congressional districts. The elections coincided with the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the House of Representatives, elections to the United States Senate, and various state and local elections. The primary elections were held on June 25, 2024.<br/><br/>Democrats flipped three seats held by Republicans, and a total of four from the previous election (one of which they flipped in a special election earlier in 2024), despite the concurrent presidential election in the state swinging the most towards Republicans of any state in the nation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 2020–2024 redistricting process ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Following the 2020 census, New York lost one congressional seat and its Independent Redistricting Commission (I.R.C.) attempted to draw a new map. However, they could not reach an agreement on the map, and the Democratic-dominated New York State Legislature drew their own new Congressional map. In April 2022, in the lead-up to the 2022 midterms, the New York State Court of Appeals struck down the map as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that failed to follow the proper procedures. The Court then appointed an Independent Special Master to create a new map.<br/><br/>In the 2022 House election in New York, under the new map, the Republican Party flipped 3 seats, bringing the new seat count of 15 for the Democrats and 11 held by Republicans. In March 2023, New York Democrats challenged the new map, deeming it incorrect for the Court to draw the map, claiming that the job lies solely with the Legislature and I.R.C. In July 2023, an intermediate appeals court ruled that the I.R.C. must create another new map for the 2024 House Elections.
