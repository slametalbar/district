            North Beach is a neighborhood in the northeast of San Francisco adjacent to Chinatown, the Financial District, and Russian Hill. The neighborhood is San Francisco's "Little Italy" and has historically been home to a large Italian American population, largely from Northern Italy. It still has many Italian restaurants and a sizeable Italian community, though many other ethnic groups currently live in the neighborhood. It was also the historic center of the beatnik subculture and has become one of San Francisco's main nightlife districts as well as a residential neighborhood populated by a mix of young urban professionals, families, and Chinese immigrants.<br/><br/>The American Planning Association (APA) has named North Beach as one of ten "Great Neighborhoods in America".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Location ==<br/><br/>North Beach is bounded by the former Barbary Coast, now Jackson Square, the Financial District south of Broadway, Chinatown to the southwest of Columbus below Green Street, Russian Hill to the west, Telegraph Hill to the east and Fisherman's Wharf at Bay Street to the north.<br/><br/>Main intersections are Union and Columbus, the southwest corner of Washington Square, Grant Avenue, and Vallejo Street.<br/><br/>The neighborhood consists of modern, mid-century apartments, duplexes, and Victorian homes and multiplexes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Originally, the city's northeast shoreline extended only to what is today Taylor and Francisco streets. The area largely known today as North Beach was an actual beach, filled in with land fill around the late 19th century.
