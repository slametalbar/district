            The following is a list of notable Turkish Americans, including both original immigrants of full or partial Turkish descent who obtained American citizenship and their American descendants. <br/><br/>Most notable Turkish Americans have come from, or originate from, Turkey but there are also notable Americans of Turkish origin who have immigrated from, or descend from, the other former Ottoman territories, especially Turks from the Balkans, the island of Cyprus (e.g. Erden Eruç, Halil Güven, Hal Ozsan, Abdul Kerim al-Qubrusi, and Vamık Volkan, are of Turkish Cypriot origin), North Africa (e.g. Leila Ahmed and Nonie Darwish are of Turkish-Egyptian origin, and Mustapha Osman was of Turkish-Tunisian origin), and the Levant (e.g. Etel Adnan is of Turkish-Syrian origin; David Chokachi and Salih Neftçi are of Turkish-Iraqi origin; Nabila Khashoggi is from the Khashoggi family who are of Turkish origin). <br/><br/>Some Turkish Americans have also come to the US from areas where there is a modern Turkish diaspora; for example, Turhan Bey had a Turkish-Austrian background; Timothy Guy Kent has a Turkish Canadian background; Marie Tepe had a Turkish-French background; Ergun Caner has a Turkish-Swedish background; Kasim Edebali has a Turkish-German background; and Didem Erol has a Turkish Australian background. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Academia ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sibel Adalı, Professor of Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute<br/><br/>Leila Ahmed, Professor of Women's Studies in Religion at Harvard Divinity School<br/><br/>Ali Akansu,  Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NJIT<br/><br/>Cevdet Akbay, Professor of Chemistry at Fayetteville State University<br/><br/>Murat Arcak,<br/><br/>Esra Akcan,  Professor of Architecture at Cornell University<br/><br/>Bilal Akin,<br/><br/>Mustafa Aksakal, professor of history at Georgetown University<br/><br/>İlhan Aksay, Professor in Engineering and Emeritus Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Princeton University<br/><br/>Asuman Aksoy, Professor of Mathematics at Claremont McKenna College<br/><br/>Serap Aksoy, Professor of Epidemiology (Microbial Diseases) at Yale University<br/><br/>Ian F.
