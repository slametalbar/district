            Kitchener Centre (French: Kitchener-Centre) is a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1997.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>The district includes the north-central and north-eastern parts of the city of Kitchener, Ontario, including the downtown core.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Political geography ==<br/><br/>In 2008, the race in Kitchener was razor thin between the Conservatives and Liberals. Politically, the riding is split by the Conestoga Parkway—the area to the west of the Parkway tends to support the Liberals while the area to the east of it tends to vote for the Conservatives. The New Democrats also won a small handful of polls, scattered around the riding.<br/><br/>In 2019, The Greens saw one of their largest increases as their share of the vote jumped up 23 points, from 3% to 26%, and took second place from the Conservatives. In terms of vote share and margin of loss, this was the Greens' most successful result in Ontario (even better than neighbouring Guelph, which has a Green MPP) and part of their surge in the south west of the province. In 2021, despite a nationwide vote collapse for the Greens, returning candidate Mike Morrice was able to pull off an upset win, largely helped by the collapse in support for the incumbent Liberal MP, Raj Saini, being involved in sexual assault allegations. This makes Morrice the first ever Green MP from Ontario on the federal level.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Demographics ==<br/><br/>According to the 2021 Canadian census<br/><br/>Ethnic groups: 71.5% White, 7.9% Black, 5.8% South Asian, 3.3% Indigenous, 2.5% Latin American, 2.1% Southeast Asian, 1.9% Arab, 1.3% Chinese, 1.0% West Asian<br/><br/>Languages: 70.1% English, 2.6% German, 2.0% Spanish, 1.9% Arabic, 1.7% German, 1.6% Tigrigna, 1.5% Serbian, 1.2% Portuguese, 1.1% Romanian, 1.0% French<br/><br/>Religions: 53.4% Christian (22.2% Catholic, 4.3% Christian Orthodox, 3.6% Lutheran, 2.8% United Church, 2.5% Anglican, 1.4% Presbyterian, 1.4% Pentecostal, 1.4% Anabaptist, 1.2% Baptist, 12.6% other), 5.9% Muslim, 2.6% Hindu, 1.0% Sikh, 35.0% none<br/><br/>Median income: $40,800 (2020) <br/><br/>Average income: $50,440 (2020)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The electoral district was created in 1996 from parts of Kitchener and Kitchener—Waterloo ridings.
