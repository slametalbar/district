            In the United States, between 6% and 11% of the population demonstrated nonreligious attitudes and naturalistic worldviews, namely atheists or agnostics.: 1 : 18  24% of people who do not believe in God or a universal spirit call themselves atheists. Other given answers are: "Nothing in particular", "Agnostics", "Christians", "Jewish", "Buddhists", "Other religions" and "Don't know/Refused". Atheists are between 4% and 7% of American adults.: 18  Agnostics make up between 4 and 5% of the adult population.: 18  <br/><br/>A growing proportion of people appear to be reporting no religious affiliation on surveys. The percentage of Americans without religious affiliation, often labeled as "Nones", is between 22 and 31%.: 18  "No answer" is between 2 and 3%. According to Gallup, the "None" answer to "religious preference" has grown from 2% in 1948 to 22% in 2023. "Other" and "No answer" have been somewhat stable. According to Pew, all three subgroups that together make up the religious "nones" have grown over time: in 2021, atheists were 4% (up from 2% in 2011), 5% agnostics (3% a decade before) and 20% "nothing in particular" (14% ten years before).: 3  In 2023, atheists are still 4%. However, an Interdisciplinary Journal of Research on Religion article says atheists were already about 4% around 2008 and that had been the case since at least the 1940s.: 8  Most of the increase in the unaffiliated comes from people who had weak or no commitment to religion in the first place, not from people who had a religious commitment. The decrease in strong belief was slower. Still, "Nones" is an unclear category.
