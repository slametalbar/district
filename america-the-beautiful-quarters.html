            The America the Beautiful quarters (sometimes abbreviated ATB quarters) were a series of fifty-six 25-cent pieces (quarters) issued by the United States Mint, which began in 2010 and lasted until 2021. The obverse (front) of all the coins depicts George Washington in a modified version of the portrait used for the original 1932 Washington quarter. There were five new reverse (back) designs each year (one in 2021), each commemorating a national natural or historic site such as national parks, national historic sites, or national forests – one from each state, the federal district, and each territory. The program was authorized by the America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110–456 (text) (PDF).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Coin designs ==<br/><br/>Quarters were issued with reverse designs commemorating national parks and sites in the order of which that park or site was deemed a national site. The quarters from three states depict parks or sites that were previously portrayed on the state quarters (Grand Canyon in Arizona, Yosemite in California, and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota). While they depict the same sites, they bear new designs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Privy mark ===<br/><br/>In 2020, the obverses of the quarters struck at West Point also include a privy mark. The privy design features the text "V75", celebrating the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II inside an outline of the Rainbow Pool at the World War II Memorial in Washington, DC.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Mint marks ==<br/><br/>Over the course of the series, four mint marks were used on the America the Beautiful quarters.
