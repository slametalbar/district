            American pioneers, also known as American settlers, were European American, Asian American, and free African American settlers who migrated westward from the Thirteen Colonies and later the United States of America to settle and develop areas of the nation within the continent of North America.<br/><br/>The pioneer concept and ethos greatly predate the migration to the Western United States, with which they are commonly associated, and many places now considered "East" were settled by pioneers from even further east. For example, Daniel Boone, a key figure in U.S. history, settled in Kentucky, when that "Dark and Bloody Ground" was still undeveloped.<br/><br/>One important development in the Western settlement were the Homestead Acts, which provided formal legislation for settlers which regulated the settlement process with little to no concern for the Native inhabitants of the land. Pioneers also settled on land that was once inhabited by American Indian tribes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>The word "pioneer" originates with the Middle French pionnier (originally, a foot soldier, or soldier involved in digging trenches), from the same root as peon or pawn. In the English language, the term independently evolved a sense of being an innovator or trailblazer. As early as 1664, Englishman John Evelyn used the term with a self-effacing "workman" meaning when he wrote in his treatise on planting, Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees: "I speak now in relation to the Royal Society, not my self, who am but a Servant of it only and a Pioneer in the Works".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Pioneers ==<br/><br/>Various figures in American folklore and literature typify the pioneer.  James Fenimore Cooper's The Deerslayer (1841) became the most successful of his early series, the Leatherstocking Tales, about pioneer life in the Province of New York.
