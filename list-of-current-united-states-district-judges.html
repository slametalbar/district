            The following is a list of all current judges of the United States district and territorial courts. The list includes both "active" and "senior" judges, both of whom hear and decide cases. There are 89 districts in the 50 states, with a total of 94 districts including four territories and the District of Columbia. Each of the 50 states has between one and four Article III district courts, and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico each have one Article III district court. Article III judges have lifetime tenure.<br/><br/>The insular areas of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the United States Virgin Islands each have one Article IV territorial court. These courts are called "district courts" and exercise the same jurisdiction as district courts; however, Article IV territorial courts differ from Article III district courts in that territorial courts have judges who serve ten-year terms rather than lifetime tenures.<br/><br/>As of January 2025, Congress has authorized 677 permanent district judgeships, though the number of actual judges will be higher than 677 because of some judges electing senior status. Only active, non-senior-status judges may fill one of the 677 authorized judgeships. In addition, a small number of judges are concurrently appointed to more than one judgeship.
