            The District is an American crime drama and police procedural television series that aired on CBS from October 7, 2000, to May 1, 2004. The show followed the work and personal life of the chief of Washington, D.C.'s police department.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Premise ==<br/><br/>Former Newark, New Jersey Police Commissioner and New York Transit police officer Jack Mannion is hired as the chief of the bureaucracy-laden Washington, D.C. police force. Together with his detectives and allies, he must fight crime as well as internal corruption and the powers of Congress in order to reorganize and renovate the force.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Production ==<br/><br/>The District was inspired by the real-life experience of former New York City Deputy Police Commissioner Jack Maple. Along with Police Commissioner William Bratton, he had reorganized the NYPD, and one of the achievements was the CompStat program (comparative statistics), which has its own major role in the TV series. After the success in New York, the CompStat program has been adapted by other cities. However Jack Maple himself chose to publish his experiences—along with Chris Mitchell he wrote a book (The Crime Fighter, 2000), and along with Terry George he prepared a TV series concept. His impact on the storyline after season 1 was limited; he died of colon cancer on August 4, 2001.<br/><br/>Primary filming was in Los Angeles, with some location shooting in Washington, D.C.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Episodes ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cast and characters ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Main ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Recurring ===<br/><br/>Jean Smart as Det.
