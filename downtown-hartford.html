Downtown also serves as the hub for the bus routes of Connecticut Transit Hartford. Union Station is located in the western part of downtown.<br/><br/>Downtown is also home to the Hartford City Hall, the Hartford Public Library, which is undergoing a major expansion and renovation, the Old State House, which is one of the oldest state houses in the nation, the Wadsworth Atheneum which is the oldest public art museum in the country, Travelers Tower, historic Hotel Bond, Bushnell Park, and the Connecticut State Capitol and Legislative Office Complex.<br/><br/>The south downtown area south of Bushnell Park is the site of several imposing buildings built in the early decades of the 20th century as the headquarters for large insurance companies.
