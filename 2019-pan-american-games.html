            The 2019 Pan American Games (Spanish: Juegos Panamericanos de 2019), officially the XVIII Pan American Games (Spanish: XVIII Juegos Panamericanos) and commonly known as Lima 2019, were a multi-sport event governed by the Panam Sports Organization held in Lima, Peru from July 26 to August 11, 2019, with preliminary rounds in certain events having begun on July 24, 2019. These were the first Pan American Games to be held in Peru, and the seventh to be held in South America.<br/><br/>The opening ceremony took place on July 26 at the National Stadium of Peru, and the Games were declared open by former Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra. These Pan American Games were held at venues in and around Lima, and are the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Bidding process ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>A total of four bids were submitted for the 2019 Pan American Games, and they were officially announced on February 1, 2013. These were Lima in Peru, Santiago in Chile, Ciudad Bolívar in Venezuela and La Punta in Argentina. Lima bid for the games for the second consecutive time after losing to Toronto for the 2015 edition of the games. Santiago had won the rights to stage the 1975 and 1987 Pan American Games but withdrew both times before hosting. The other two cities bid for the games for the first time. Lima was elected as the host city on October 11, 2013, where PASO members gathered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to elect the host city.
