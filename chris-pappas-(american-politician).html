            Christopher Charles Pappas ( PAPP-əss; born June 4, 1980) is an American politician who has served as the U.S. representative from New Hampshire's 1st congressional district since 2019. A member of the Democratic Party, Pappas previously served on the New Hampshire Executive Council from 2013 to 2019.<br/><br/>Pappas is the first openly gay man to represent New Hampshire in Congress and is currently the only man in the state's congressional delegation. His district covers much of the southern and eastern parts of New Hampshire and includes the state's largest city, Manchester, as well as the Seacoast and the Lakes Region.<br/><br/>On April 3, 2025, Pappas announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat to which Jeanne Shaheen had declined to run for reelection in 2026.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Pappas was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, the son of Dawn and Arthur Pappas. His paternal great-grandfather, also named Arthur Pappas, arrived in New Hampshire as a new American citizen in the early 20th century, having recently emigrated from Greece. In 1917 Arthur Pappas and his cousin Louis Canota founded an ice cream shop in Manchester. By 1919 they had expanded the business into a restaurant, now known as the Puritan Backroom, and in 1949 they added a function room. In 1974 Charlie Pappas, grandfather of Chris Pappas and co-owner of the Puritan at the time, invented the chicken tender.
