            Murshidabad district is a district in the Indian state of West Bengal. Situated on the left bank of the river Ganges, the district is very fertile. Covering an area of 5,341 km2 (2,062 sq mi) and having a population 7.103 million (according to 2011 census), it is a densely populated district and the ninth most populous in India (out of 640). Berhampore city is the headquarters of the district.<br/><br/>The Murshidabad city, which lends its name to the district, was the seat of power of the Nawabs of Bengal. All of Bengal was once governed from this city. A few years after Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula lost to the British at the Battle of Plassey, the capital of Bengal was moved to the newly founded city of Calcutta, now called Kolkata.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>The district is named after the historical town of Murshidabad, which was named after Nawab Murshid Quli Khan.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The capital city of Shashanka, the great king of Gauḍa region (comprising most of Bengal) in the seventh century CE and perhaps that of Mahipala, one of the later Pala kings of Bengal, were in this district. The earliest evidences of the history of the district date back to the pre-historic days, perhaps as early as circa 1500 BCE.<br/><br/>The district got its present name in the early eighteenth century and its present shape in the later half of the eighteenth century.
