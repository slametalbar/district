            This is a list of school districts in California.<br/><br/>California school districts are of several varieties, usually a Unified district, which includes all of the Elementary and High Schools in the same geographic area; Elementary school districts, which includes K–6 or K–8 schools only, which may have several elementary districts within one high school district's geographic area; and High School Districts, which include one or more high schools in the same geographic area. Elementary districts sometimes includes the word Elementary within their names, but often do not. Sometimes the words Joint and/or Union are included in the district's name.  A joint school district serves students from more than one county. When a school district becomes divided by a new or adjusted county boundary, it automatically becomes a joint district unless otherwise specified. A union elementary school district was formed as the result of a merger between two previous school districts, while a union high school district serves students from multiple elementary school districts.<br/><br/>Elementary school districts can be classified as: city school district, regular district, union district, or joint union district. High school districts can be categorized as a union district, a joint union district, or a county district. These, along with unified school districts and community college districts, are counted as separate governments by the U.S. Census Bureau.
