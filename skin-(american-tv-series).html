            Skins is a teen comedy-drama television series that premiered on January 17, 2011, on MTV in the United States. It is a remake of the original British show of the same name and follows the lives of a group of teenagers through their final two years of high school. As with the British series, the American version features a cast of amateur actors and young writers.<br/><br/>The series generated controversy in the United States over its sexual content, in which several advertisers withdrew and there were some accusations of child pornography since most of its cast members were under the age of 18. On June 9, 2011, MTV announced that they would not renew Skins for a second season, with a statement that "Skins is a global television phenomenon that, unfortunately, did not connect with an American audience as much as we had hoped. We admire the work that the series creator Bryan Elsley did in adapting the show for MTV, and appreciate the core audience that embraced it."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cast and characters ==<br/><br/>The characters in the American version are the same as those in the British version, although some first names have been changed and all last names have been changed except for Michelle Richardson. The biggest change comes in the form of new character Tea Marvelli, a lesbian cheerleader who replaces the British character Maxxie Oliver.<br/><br/><br/><br/>James Newman as Tony Schneider (styled on Tony Stonem of the original British version)<br/><br/>Tony begins the season as the leader of the group, but as his relationship with Michelle starts to crumble due to cheating on her with Tea, his popularity and power within the group crumbles as well. He ends the series with the realization that his friends, particularly Stanley, and his sister Eura mean more to him than he actually thought.<br/><br/>Rachel Thevenard as Michelle Richardson<br/><br/>In the beginning of the season Michelle is in a relationship with Tony, which causes her to act like she enjoys the role of the good-looking girlfriend and ignore her real feelings.
