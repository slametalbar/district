            The Plot Against America is an American alternate history drama television miniseries created and written by David Simon and Ed Burns, based on the 2004 novel of the same name by Philip Roth, that aired on HBO from March 16, 2020, to April 20, 2020.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Premise ==<br/><br/>The Plot Against America "imagines an alternate American history told through the eyes of a working-class Jewish family in Newark, New Jersey, as they watch the political rise of Charles Lindbergh, an aviator-hero and xenophobic populist, who becomes president and turns the nation toward fascism."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Production ==<br/><br/>HBO announced on November 8, 2018, that it had ordered a six-episode miniseries based on Philip Roth's novel The Plot Against America to be written by David Simon and Ed Burns and executive produced by Simon, Burns, and Roth, alongside Joe Roth, Jeff Kirschenbaum, Nina Noble, Megan Ellison, Sue Naegle, Susan Goldberg, and Dennis Stratton. Production companies involved with the series include Annapurna Pictures and Blown Deadline Productions. In April 2019, Winona Ryder, Zoe Kazan, Morgan Spector, John Turturro, Anthony Boyle, Azhy Robertson, and Caleb Malis joined the cast of the series.<br/><br/>"The Road is Open Again", written in 1933 for Franklin D. Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration, was used for the opening theme song, performed by actor Michael Kostroff.<br/><br/>Simon had read the novel in 2004, but thought it politically irrelevant; though approached by Tom Rothman in 2013 to adapt it for television, he declined. He decided to take on the project in the aftermath of the 2016 US election, in which Donald Trump was elected US President, saying that Roth's novel had proven "perversely...allegorical," and approaching his longtime collaborator Ed Burns, with whom he had worked on The Wire and Generation Kill, to co-write. Events such as the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville influenced the adaptation.<br/><br/>A point of concern was the show's ending, about which Simon approached Roth, and to which Roth provided no solution. Simon and Burns chose a more ambiguous conclusion than the novel's, though one more directly involving characters in ending the Lindbergh administration, and expanded the perspective beyond just the novel's narrator, Philip.
