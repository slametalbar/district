            The Royal Neighbors of America National Home, also known as Grandview Terrace, is a nationally recognized historic district located on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River in the west end of Davenport, Iowa, United States.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. At the time of its nomination, it consisted of eight resources, which included two contributing buildings, one contributing site, one contributing structure, two contributing objects, and two non-contributing buildings. The main building was demolished in 2018.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Founded in 1895, Royal Neighbors of America was the first fraternal benefit society that provided life insurance protection for women. It is based across the river from Davenport in Rock Island, Illinois. In 1929 Royal Neighbors passed a resolution to establish a facility that would provide a home for mothers and other women in their organization who were in need of assistance. They bought 40 acres (16 ha) of land along Rockingham Road in Davenport's west end in February 1930.<br/><br/>The Davenport architectural firm of Clausen, Kruse &amp; Klein designed the facility in the Georgian Revival style. The building featured a columned porch that extended across the front of the building and a living room with floor-to-ceiling windows and a fireplace.
