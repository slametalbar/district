            Gilbert Unified School District #41 (GUSD), also known as Gilbert Public Schools (GPS), is a school district based in Gilbert, Arizona, United States in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The 60.26-square-mile (156.1 km2) district is the 7th largest in Arizona, and serves over 34,000 students at 39 schools across Gilbert, Chandler, and Mesa, Arizona.<br/><br/>In 2018, the district was awarded "4th Best School District in America" by the National Council for Home Safety and Security and "Best Public School/District" in the Best of Gilbert 2018 issue of the East Valley Tribune. As of spring 2019, thirteen GPS schools have earned the "A+ School of Excellence™ Award" from the Arizona Educational Foundation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1900, the first school, in Gilbert, was built on the southwest corner of Baseline and Cooper Roads. This school was moved, in 1909, to the northeast corner of Guadalupe and Cooper Roads. It was named Highland because it was the highest land south of the Salt River. These schools were part of the Mesa Unified School District#4.<br/><br/>In 1913, with the completion of its first elementary school, the Gilbert School District #41 was formed. The new school was located on the corner of Elliot and Gilbert roads, and consisted of four classrooms, two offices, an auditorium and a full basement below the auditorium.
