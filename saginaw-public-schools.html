            Saginaw Public Schools, also known as the School District of the City of Saginaw and Saginaw Public School District (SPSD), is a school district in Saginaw, Michigan. The district is a part of the Saginaw Intermediate School District, and serves the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee, the eastern part of Kochville Township, and portions of Buena Vista Township north of Hess Avenue.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The original Arthur Hill High School was located at Court and Harrison Streets and was built in 1888. By 1936 the campus consisted of five buildings.<br/><br/>The new Arthur Hill High School opened in January 1940, with 45 percent of construction costs funded by the federal government. The architecture firm was Frantz &amp; Spence. The building featured technology such as an "electric eye" in each classroom to control the lights.<br/><br/>Saginaw High School consisted of two buildings separated by busy Warren Avenue, one built in 1879 and the other built in 1903. By 1948, the campus was considered overcrowded and a fire hazard. That year, its bell tower was demolished due to fear that it would collapse.
